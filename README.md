# School Management System


This GitHub project is a Student Management System that demonstrates the integration of frontend and backend technologies to create a full-stack web application. The frontend of the application is built using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and JavaScript, while the backend utilizes Spring Boot to create a RESTful API for managing student details. The API endpoints allow users to perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on student data.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: The frontend is designed with a clean and responsive user interface using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, ensuring a seamless experience across different devices.

- **Interactive and Dynamic**: JavaScript is employed to enhance the user experience by providing dynamic content updates without the need for page refreshes.

- **RESTful API with Spring Boot**: The backend is powered by Spring Boot, creating a robust and efficient REST API that follows RESTful principles for managing student data.

- **CRUD Operations**: Through the REST API, users can perform the following operations:
  - **Create**: Add new student details to the database.
  - **Read**: Retrieve and display student information from the database.
  - **Update**: Modify existing student records with updated information.
  - **Delete**: Remove student records from the database.

- **Data Connectivity**: JavaScript bridges the gap between the frontend and backend by making asynchronous requests to the REST API. This enables real-time data synchronization between the user interface and the database.

## Technologies Used

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML: Structuring the web pages and content.
  - CSS: Styling the application for an appealing user interface.
  - Bootstrap: Quickly creating responsive and visually pleasing designs.
  - JavaScript: Adding interactivity and making API requests.

- **Backend**:
  - Spring Boot: Creating a powerful and efficient backend server.
  - REST API: Defining endpoints for performing CRUD operations.
  
- **Database**:
  - A relational database (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) is used to store student data.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Configure and set up the backend by running the Spring Boot application.
3. Access the frontend by opening the HTML file in a web browser.
4. Use the user interface to interact with the application:
   - Add new student details.
   - View existing student records.
   - Update student information.
   - Delete student records.

Please ensure you have the necessary tools and dependencies installed before running the application.
